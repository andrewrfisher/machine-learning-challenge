# machine-learning-challenge

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

-Preprocess the raw data

-Tune the models

-Compare two or more models

 **this assignment is not fully completed. I have yet to sucessfully load load using joblib and still need to finish my analysis, however, the models were successfully completed. I will complete and resubmit.
